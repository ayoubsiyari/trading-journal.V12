Modern Minimalist Design System
This design emphasizes a clean, professional, and highly readable user experience, suitable for data-intensive applications like trading dashboards. It combines a sophisticated aesthetic with clear functional elements.
1. Color Palette & Background:
Primary Background: A subtle gradient from a light indigo/blue to a light cyan/white (e.g., from-indigo-50 via-white to-cyan-50 in Tailwind CSS) for a fresh, airy feel in light mode. For dark mode, a gradient from dark gray to slightly lighter dark gray (from-gray-900 via-gray-800 to-gray-900) provides a deep, professional backdrop.
Accent Colors: Vibrant but not overwhelming colors are used for key data points and interactive elements. Emerald green (emerald-500/600) for positive values, red (red-500/600) for negative, and shades of indigo (indigo-500/600) and cyan (cyan-500/600) for highlights, branding, and interactive components.
Neutral Tones: A range of grays (gray-100 to gray-900) are used for text, borders, and subtle backgrounds to ensure readability and provide visual separation.
2. Layout & Structure:
Clean Grid System: Content is organized using a responsive grid layout (e.g., grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-X) to ensure elements are well-aligned and spaced, adapting smoothly across different screen sizes.
Defined Sections: Clear visual separation between different content blocks (e.g., header, KPIs, charts, tables) using consistent padding (p-6, py-8, px-6) and margins (mb-8).
Hero Elements: Key information (like Total P&L) is given prominence in larger, more visually impactful cards to draw immediate attention.
Sticky Header (Optional): A fixed header with a subtle backdrop blur (backdrop-blur-xl) and slight transparency (bg-white/80 or bg-gray-900/80) can be used for persistent navigation and controls.
3. Component Styling (Cards & Containers):
Subtle Depth: Cards and containers feature soft shadows (shadow-sm, shadow-md) and thin, light borders (border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700) to create a sense of depth without being heavy.
Rounded Corners: Generous use of rounded-xl or rounded-2xl for a modern, friendly aesthetic.
Hover Effects: Subtle transition-colors and hover:bg-opacity or hover:shadow-lg for interactive elements to provide visual feedback.
4. Typography:
Clean Sans-Serif Fonts: Prioritize readability with modern sans-serif fonts. Use varying font weights (font-bold, font-semibold, font-medium) and sizes (text-sm, text-lg, text-2xl, text-5xl) to establish a clear visual hierarchy.
Uppercase Labels: Use uppercase and tracking-wider for section titles and metric labels to add a professional touch.
5. Data Visualization (Charts & Tables):
Minimalist Charts: Charts (Area, Bar, Pie) use clean lines, subtle grid patterns (stroke-dasharray), and the established accent colors for data representation. Avoid overly complex chart elements.
Clear Tooltips: Tooltips are styled cleanly with a solid background, border, and clear text for easy data interpretation on hover.
Readable Tables: Tables have clear headers, subtle row dividers, and consistent padding. Text colors are chosen for optimal readability against the background.
6. Interactive Elements (Buttons, Selects):
Consistent Styling: Buttons and select inputs maintain a consistent look with rounded corners, appropriate padding, and clear hover/focus states.
Gradient Buttons: Key action buttons (e.g.,

**Design System Prompt: Modern Minimalist & Professional Analytics**

**Objective:** Apply a clean, professional, and highly readable aesthetic to all pages, maintaining consistency with the Dashboard.jsx component.

**Core Principles:**
1.  **Cleanliness & Readability:** Prioritize clear information hierarchy and easy readability.
2.  **Subtle Depth:** Use soft shadows and thin borders for a modern, layered look.
3.  **Responsiveness:** Ensure seamless adaptation across all device sizes.
4.  **Functional Aesthetics:** Design elements should enhance, not distract from, data and functionality.

**Key Elements to Implement:**

**A. Color & Background:**
    *   **Light Mode Background:** Subtle gradient from light indigo/blue to light cyan/white (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-50 via-white to-cyan-50`).
    *   **Dark Mode Background:** Deep gray gradient (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 via-gray-800 to-gray-900`).
    *   **Accent Colors:** Emerald for positive, Red for negative. Indigo and Cyan for branding/highlights.
    *   **Neutrals:** Extensive use of gray scale for text, borders, and subtle backgrounds.

**B. Layout & Structure:**
    *   **Grid-Based Layout:** Utilize responsive CSS Grid (e.g., `grid grid-cols-X`) for organized content alignment.
    *   **Consistent Spacing:** Apply uniform padding and margins (e.g., `p-6`, `mb-8`) across all components and sections.
    *   **Prominent Hero Sections:** Highlight key information with larger, visually impactful cards or sections.
    *   **Clear Sectioning:** Use distinct containers and subtle borders to separate content blocks.

**C. Component Styling (Cards, Containers, Buttons):**
    *   **Rounded Corners:** Apply `rounded-xl` or `rounded-2xl` for a modern, soft appearance.
    *   **Subtle Shadows:** Use `shadow-sm` or `shadow-md` for depth without heaviness.
    *   **Glassmorphism (Optional, for premium feel):** Apply `backdrop-blur-xl` and `bg-opacity` for translucent elements (e.g., header, specific cards).
    *   **Interactive Feedback:** Implement `transition-colors` and `hover:bg-opacity` or `hover:shadow-lg` for all interactive elements.
    *   **Buttons:** Use subtle gradients (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-600 to-cyan-600`) for primary actions; clean, border-based styles for secondary actions.

**D. Typography:**
    *   **Sans-Serif Fonts:** Prioritize clean, readable sans-serif typefaces.
    *   **Hierarchical Sizing:** Use varying font sizes and weights (`font-bold`, `font-semibold`, `font-medium`) to establish clear visual hierarchy.
    *   **Uppercase Labels:** Apply `uppercase` and `tracking-wider` for section titles and metric labels.

**E. Data Visualization (Charts, Tables):**
    *   **Minimalist Charts:** Clean lines, subtle grid patterns, and consistent accent colors for data representation.
    *   **Clear Tooltips:** Clean, solid background tooltips with clear text.
    *   **Readable Tables:** Defined headers, subtle row dividers, and clear text colors.

**F. Interactive Elements (Inputs, Selects):**
    *   **Consistent Styling:** Uniform appearance with rounded corners, appropriate padding, and clear hover/focus states.

**Goal:** Ensure every page reflects this modern, minimalist, and professional aesthetic, providing a cohesive and intuitive user experience across your entire application.
